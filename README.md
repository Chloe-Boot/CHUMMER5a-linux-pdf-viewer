# CHUMMER5a-linux-pdf-viewer
A quick and dirty script to open pdf files from chummer directly in your native linux pdf viewer of choice.

## Installation
1. Move the script to a location accessable by your current WINE prefix.
2. Chance the pdf viewer on line 24
3. In chummer, select the script in options under '_location of PDF application_'

## Warning
It is an absolute garbage piece of code. First time working with a batch file and the weird layers between linux/wine. If you think you can improve it feel free to send a pull request.
